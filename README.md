# KSP2 Space Warp Verifier

The "KSP2 Space Warp Verifier" GitHub Action is a powerful tool for ensuring the integrity and consistency of your Kerbal Space Program 2 (KSP2) mods. This action automates the verification process, focusing on the "version_check" and "swinfo.json" aspects.

## Features

- **Version Check Validation**: The action verifies the validity of the "version_check" in your KSP2 mod, ensuring it meets the required format and standards.
- **SWInfo.json Verification**: It checks that there is only one instance of the "swinfo.json" file present in your mod directory, preventing conflicts or unintended modifications.
